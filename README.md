# Cab_Booking_LLD
LLD to book a cab

# Problem Statement:

We want to build a cab booking platform to allow a rider to book a cab.

# Details:

The location is represented as a (x, y) coordinate.

Distance between two points (x1, y1) and(x2, y2) is sqrt((x1-x2)² + (y1-y2)²)

Platform has decided upon maximum distance a driver has to travel to pickup a rider.

A cab has only 1 driver.

Sharing of cab is not allowed between riders

There is a single type of cab

# Please build an application that exposes following features to riders and drivers.

1. Register a rider.

2. Register a driver/cab

3. Update a cab’s location

4. A driver can switch on/off his availability

5. A rider can book a cab

6. Fetch history of all rides taken by a rider.

7. End the Trip
